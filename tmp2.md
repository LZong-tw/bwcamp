Based on the EXPLAIN output you've provided, there are several areas where we can optimize the database and query:

1. Add Indexes:

    - user_applicant_xrefs: Add composite index on (user_id, applicant_id)
    - org_user: Add composite index on (user_id, org_id, user_type)
    - camp_org: Add index on (camp_id) if not already present
    - evcamp: Add composite index on (applicant_id, batch_id)

2. Optimize Table Structure:

    - Ensure that foreign keys are properly set up and indexed
    - Consider denormalizing some data if it's frequently accessed together

3. Query Optimization:
    - Rewrite the query to reduce subqueries and use JOINs where possible
    - Use EXISTS clauses instead of IN for better performance with large datasets

Here's an optimized version of the query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT u.*
FROM users u
JOIN user_applicant_xrefs uax ON u.id = uax.user_id
JOIN applicants a ON a.id = uax.applicant_id
JOIN evcamp e ON a.id = e.applicant_id
LEFT JOIN org_user ou ON u.id = ou.user_id
LEFT JOIN camp_org co ON ou.org_id = co.id
WHERE a.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND e.batch_id IN (167, 168)
  AND (
    co.camp_id = 77
    OR NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM org_user ou2
      JOIN camp_org co2 ON ou2.org_id = co2.id
      WHERE ou2.user_id = u.id
        AND ou2.user_type = 'App\Models\User'
        AND co2.camp_id = 77
    )
  )
  AND ou.user_type = 'App\Models\User';
```

4. Database Configuration:

    - Increase innodb_buffer_pool_size if you have enough RAM
    - Optimize mysql configuration parameters based on your server specifications

5. Application-level Optimization:

    - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
    - Use pagination to limit the number of records returned at once

6. Regular Maintenance:

    - Regularly run ANALYZE TABLE to update statistics
    - Consider partitioning large tables if appropriate

7. Monitor and Profile:

    - Use tools like MySQL Workbench or pt-query-digest to identify slow queries
    - Set up monitoring for long-running queries and optimize them

8. Consider using a Read Replica:
    - If this is a read-heavy operation, consider setting up a read replica to offload queries from the primary database

Remember to test these optimizations thoroughly in a staging environment before applying them to production. Also, always backup your database before making significant changes.
